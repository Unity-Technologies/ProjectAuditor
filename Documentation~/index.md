# About Project Auditor
Project Auditor is a static analysis tool for Unity projects, which finds potential issues related to memory consumption, performance and other areas.

Use the Project Auditor package to analyse scripts and settings of your project. The tool creates a list of potential issues which have been identified, then the user will need to determine whether they are real issues or not.

## Installation
At this time, Project Auditor is not discoverable via Package Manager so it has to be installed manually.

It is recommended to install Project Auditor via the _Add package from git URL_ in Package Manager. For more information on this and alternative installation methods please refer to [Installing Project Auditor](Installing.md).

## How to Use
The Project Auditor editor window can be opened via *Window => Analysis => Project Auditor*. Click the Analyze button, then select a _View_ from the drop-down menu to review the list of potential issues to determine whether they are actual problems in your project. Every View provides:

* A series of filters to narrow down the visible list of issues
* The ability to "Mute" issues which have been investigated and found not to be a problem
* The ability to export the View to a .csv file for use in build reports or automated testing

For more information, check the [Getting started](GettingStarted.md) guide.

## Known limitations
Here are several Project Auditor's known limitations:

* It reports issues in code that might be stripped by the build process.
* It cannot distinguish between different versions of an API method with different parameters/return types: for example, it can't differentiate between public Component[] GetComponentsInChildren(Type type, bool includeInactive = false); (which allocates managed memory) and public void GetComponentsInChildren(List<T> results); (which doesn't), so it reports both.
* It is unable to distinguish between "hot" and "cold" code paths, except by checking if a method is in (or is a called by) one of the standard MonoBehaviour (Fixed/Late)Update methods.
* The call tree analysis does not support virtual methods.

## Reporting issues
If you have issues running Project Auditor in your Unity project, please report them on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ProjectAuditor/issues).

## Requirements
Project Auditor is meant to be compatible with all versions of Unity, however, the latest [Long-Term Support](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases) version is recommended.
