# About Project Auditor
Project Auditor is an experimental static analysis tool that analyzes assets, settings, and scripts of the Unity project and produces a report that contains the following:

* Code and Settings Diagnostics: a list of possible problems that might affect performance, memory and other areas.
* BuildReport: timing and size information of the last build.
* Assets information

## Requirements
Project Auditor is meant to be compatible with Unity versions from 2018.4 to the latest [Long-Term Support](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases) (recommended). 

Note that most recent Project Auditor version to support 2017 or earlier is [0.5.0-preview](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ProjectAuditor/releases/tag/0.5.0-preview).

## Installation
At this time, Project Auditor is not discoverable via Package Manager so it has to be installed manually.

It is recommended to install Project Auditor via the _Add package from git URL_ in Package Manager. For more information on this and alternative installation methods please refer to [Installing Project Auditor](Installing.md).

## How to Use
The Project Auditor editor window can be opened via *Window => Analysis => Project Auditor*. Click the Analyze button, then select a _View_ from the drop-down menu to review the list of potential issues to determine whether they are actual problems in your project. Every View provides:

* A series of filters to narrow down the visible list of issues
* The ability to "Mute" issues which have been investigated and found not to be a problem
* The ability to export the View to a .csv file for use in build reports or automated testing

For more information, check the [Getting started](GettingStarted.md) guide.
