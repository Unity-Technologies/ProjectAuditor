# Materials View
The Materials View shows all material assets in the project's Assets folder, along with their properties and asset
import settings.

Note: The Packages folder is excluded from this scan; only the Assets folder is reviewed.

One useful way to use this view is to enable the **show/hide hierarchy** button and to select **Group By: Shader** from
the drop-down menu to easily see all of the materials that reference a particular shader.

The table columns are as follows:

| Column Name       | Column Description                                                   | 
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Material Name** | The material file name.                                              |
| **Shader**        | The name of the shader referenced by this material.                  |
| **Source Asset**  | The full path to the source material asset within the Assets folder. |
