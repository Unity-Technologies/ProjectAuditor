# Shaders View
The Shaders View shows all shader assets in the project's Assets folder.

Note that built-in shaders are reported only after building the project for the target platform.

Note: The Packages folder is excluded from this scan; only the Assets folder is reviewed.

The table columns are as follows:

| Column Name                 | Column Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Shader Name**             | The shader name, as declared inside the .shader file itself. For the actual asset file name, see the Path column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Size**                    | The file size of the shader, as reported in the most recent build report. Shaders that were not included in the build are reported as being 0 bytes in size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Num Variants**            | Number of potential shader variants for a single stage (for example: fragment), per rendering platform API (for example: Vulkan). This is the raw number of variants from considering keyword combinations, and contributes to build times and sizes. The build process may strip these variants down to a smaller number of variants that are actually included in the build. |
| **Built Fragment Variants** | Number of fragment shader variants per rendering platform API (for example: Vulkan) that were actually included in the build.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Num Passes**              | The number of passes included in this shader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Num Keywords**            | The number of keywords referenced in this shader, including both globally keywords and local keywords declared in `#pragma` statements in this shader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Num Properties**          | The number of properties in this shader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Num Tex Properties**      | The number of properties in this shader which can hold a texture object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Render Queue**            | The shader's render queue, which determines the order in which objects are renderered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Instancing**              | Shows a tick if any of this shader's passes enable GPU Instancing. See [Creating shaders that support GPU instancing](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/gpu-instancing-shader.html) for more information.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **SRP Batcher**             | Shows a tick if this shader is compatible with the [Scriptable Render Pipeline Batcher](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SRPBatcher.html).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Always Included**         | Shows a tick if this shader is on the list of [Always Included Shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GraphicsSettings.html#Built-in) in the Graphics settings. Shaders on this list do not have any variants stripped during the build process, so you should be very careful when using this list.                                                                   |
