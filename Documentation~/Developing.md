# Developing Project Auditor
Here are the steps required to setup a Unity project for Project Auditor development.

## Package
The simplest way to install Project Auditor for Development purposes is to _clone_ the repository to the `Packages` folder of your project.
Alternatively, it is possible to clone the repository to a different folder. However, note that in this case you will have to add `com.unity.project-auditor` to your `Packages.manifest.json`.

## Tests
In order to be able to run (existing or new) tests in VS/Rider or within Unity using TestRunner, it is necessary to: 
- Install `Test Framework` from Package Manager. 
- Add the following lines to your `Packages/manifest.json`:
```
 "testables": [
    "com.unity.project-auditor"
  ]
```
