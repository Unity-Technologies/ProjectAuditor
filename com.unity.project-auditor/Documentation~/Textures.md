# Textures
This Texture module reports all texture in the project along with their properties. 

##  How it works
It scans your project’s assets folder for textures, then summarizes the texture’s properties that it finds, to be easily sorted in a GUI of rows/columns. 

 Note: The Packages folder is excluded from this scan; only the Assets folder is reviewed.
