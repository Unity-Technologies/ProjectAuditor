# Roslyn Analysis
Unity 2020 introduced support for Roslyn analyzers. This feature reports all Roslyn diagnostics in the Console window. Project Auditor's Compiler Messages view provides an alternative way to report Roslyn diagnostics.

This feature requires one or more Roslyn analyzer DLLs in the Unity project, tagged with the *RoslynAnalyzer* label. In order to add a label, click in the DLL in the Project Browser and use the inspector:
