# Avatar Masks View
The Avatar Masks View shows all Avatar Mask assets in the project's Assets folder, along with their properties and asset import
settings.

Note: The Packages folder is excluded from this scan; only the Assets folder is reviewed.

The table columns are as follows:

| Column Name    | Column Description                                                               |

| **Transforms** | The number of transforms in the Avatar Mask.                                     |
| **Size**       | An estimate of the runtime memory footprint of one instance of this Avatar Mask. |
