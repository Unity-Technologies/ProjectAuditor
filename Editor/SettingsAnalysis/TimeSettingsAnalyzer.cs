This means that Unity will try to ensure that the FixedUpdate() methods of MonoBehaviours, and physics updates will be called 50 times per second. This is appropriate for games running at 60 FPS, but at 30 FPS this would mean that the FixedUpdate step will be called twice during most frames.",

The reason for having the fixed update be slightly less than the target frame rate is to avoid the “spiral of death”, in which if one frame takes longer than 33.3ms, FixedUpdate() happens multiple times on the next frame to catch up, pushing that frame time over as well, and permanently locking the game into a state where it cannot reach the desired frame rate because FixedUpdate() is constantly trying to catch up."

Spending so long in FixedUpdate() would likely mean that FixedUpdate() must also be called multiple times in the subsequent frames, contributing to the \"spiral of death\".",
